# lang-hack

This is a git repository containing various unfinished/finished code projects
written from 2014 and forward. As a result of my previous years exploring the
universe of computers.

Maybe someone will find it useful or not. To be honest, I don't care. 

You're welcome to do whatever you want with the code you find here.
